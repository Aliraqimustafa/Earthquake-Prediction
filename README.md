## Introduction

In this project, we aim to predict earthquakes using an artificial neural network. The model is trained on a dataset containing information about time, longitude, and latitude. With an accuracy of 80% on the training data, this project has the potential for further development and improvement.

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Aliraqimustafa/Earthquake-Prediction.git
cd Earthquake-Prediction
```

2. Install the required dependencies. You can do this using pip:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
3. Open the main.ipynb file to explore and work with the code.

## Dataset
The dataset used for this project can be found [here](https://digiteos-my.sharepoint.com/:f:/p/eastrada/EvKG-ROQ1iJOrXJ_Oec34_MB7iPSNHihm-SaS002VLibkA?e=feihFh).

Number of Samples: 6,063,603 (after data preprocessing)


## Usage
You can use the provided Jupyter Notebook (main.ipynb) to:

- Train the earthquake prediction model.
- Evaluate its performance.
- Make predictions.

Feel free to explore and modify the code to suit your needs and further develop the project.
